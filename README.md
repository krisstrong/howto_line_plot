# From Raw to Refined – A Step-by-Step Line Plot Transformation in Python

This project demonstrates how to take a basic `matplotlib` line plot and improve it step by step.  
We start with a default plot and progressively refine it by stripping it down, adding color and structure, and polishing the layout.

##  Goals

- Understand plot anatomy
- Practice removing unnecessary elements
- Add visual enhancements with intention
- Build polished, presentation-ready charts

##  Technologies

- Python 3
- matplotlib
- pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Files Included

| File             | Description                                  |
